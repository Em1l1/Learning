## Online shopping vs. traditional shopping

The differences between traditional shopping and online shopping are:
In traditional shopping, you can pay with cash, there is a shopping assistant who will help you in case you have any questions and there is a cashier as well who will help you to finalize the payment.

In online shopping, you are not in a physical store instead you will be in an e-commerce store, it is an online store.
A lot of these stores are easily accessible from any type of device you have. There will not be an assistant or a cashier, however, you will find other options in the menu to solve your questions.
You will not be able to take your products with you immediately, so you have to order them via delivery where you can track your package until it will arrive.

There are some things in common as shopping cart and sales.

  1. Where do you prefer to shop?
  I´d say online shopping for non-perishable things

  2. Where can you find the best discounts?
  I think in online shopping because you can use a comparator to find the best offer easily.

### Differences between Online and Traditional shopping

#### Physical Shopping

  - Can visit the place 🏬
  - Can touch the products ✋
  - Can see the products 👀
  - Maybe have an assistant 👨
  - Several payment ways 💳 💸
  - A cashier 👩‍🏭

#### E-commerce
  - Accessible from any device 📱 💻 🖥️
  - No immediate delivery 📫

#### Similarities between both

  - Shopping cart 🛒

#### Sales / Discounts

  1. Where do you prefer to shop?
  I prefer to shop in a physical store, because:
  1. You get the product Immediate
  2. I haven’t a credit/debit card yet 😞
  
  2. Where can you find the best discounts?
  I think online, there are a lot of events and discounts on holidays and other important days, like:
  Christmas, black Friday, San Valentín, etc. 📅

## Practice: Get to Know Common Shopping Items

- **Dairy products (Productos lácteos):** Milk, butter, cheese, yogurt, cream, and ice cream, all these products need refrigeration to stay cool and safe to consume.
- **Beverages (Bebidas):** Soft drinks, bottled water, soda, juices, milk, beer, wine, coffee, tea, etc. It is preferable that drinks be cold.
My favorite soda is none, it’s better to avoid them for your health and drink a lot of water. 💪🏻
- **Produce (Productos):** Food that is grown or obtained through farming… Fruits and vegetables
- **Snacks (Meriendas):** Chips, candy, cookies, nuts, seeds, etc.
- **Meat (Carne):** Porl robs, sausages, bacon, steak, beefsteak (De ahí viene el “bistec”) these products need refrigeration to stay cool and safe to consume.
- **Fish and Seafood (Pescados y mariscos):** Salmon, shrimp, lobster. sardines, etc.
- **Poultry (Aves de corral):** Chicken, turkey, eggs, geese, ducks, etc.
In my product list, I have meat, fruits, and vegetables, cheese, yogurt, eggs, and water.

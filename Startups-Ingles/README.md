## 4. Pitch and tools

### How to create a powerful, happy and speedy team

#### Culture

The culture in a company is the way how the members of the team behave, interact and react between them and with the users.

> “Create the kind of workplace and company culture that will attract great talent. If you hire brilliant people, they will make work feel more like play.”– [Richard Branson](https://platzi.com/blog/5-lecciones-de-richard-branson-sobre-retencion-de-talento/)

##### Actively listening
Active listening is a way of really listening and responding to another person that improves mutual understanding and bond. It will show that you are interested and care about them.

##### Giving them challenges
People don’t work for just money, people want to feel challenged and overcome themselves.

##### Guiding them
People will look at you not as their boss, but as their mentor, guide them towards success.

##### Teaching them
We all have different interests, give your team the chance to learn whatever they want through courses, events, books, etc.

##### Being understanding
We are all humans so treat people like that and try to understand them. Show your concern and appreciation.

##### Mission, vision and values
What do we do at our startup? Why are we doing it? What is our main motivation and how do we see ourselves in the future? These are some questions you need to ask yourself, and once you have the answer, you have got to make sure your whole team knows them too. That’s why it is essential to share this with the new members of your team, so that they all work for a purpose, because they’d know what’s the projection of the startups they are working at. And do not forget about your values, these are some golden rules that everybody who works at our startup need to know and interiorize since day one.

##### Politics
Make sure all the rules are clear from the beginning.

##### Perks
Show you appreciate them with perks. Don’t give them what they don’t need, give them something that will make them better.

##### Benefits
Remember, your team needs to take care of their health and there are a bunch of organizations, gyms, wellness centers for example, that are willing to give you discounts for your team.

##### What are we doing and why we do it
In the startup world, people work with and for a purpose, make sure your team knows where your rocket is going! 🚀

##### Onboarding
Nothing is worse than being the new guy/girl who doesn’t understand what’s going on, so make sure everything is clear from the beginning and that there is an appropriate onboarding process with the information they will need so they feel part of the startups from the start.

##### Handbook
All of this has been quite a lot of information, right? How are we going to memorize it? Impossible. For this reason, we need to create a handbook, which is basically a document where people will find this information at any time, from anywhere in the world (in case you have a remote team). This is going to be the “bible” of your startup.

##### Great documentation
It is extremely important to have the necessary documentation which is accessible for your team, especially if you work in a remote team. In Platzi we use Notion for this purpose and it is very helpful.

##### Full disclosure
Your team is helping you grow and reach your dream! The least they deserve is full disclosure and ALSO let them know what are the things that are not AT ALL TOLERATED in the startup such as racism, sexism, etc.

##### Questions
Even after 2 years at the startup where I work, sometimes I have questions and I keep learning, there is nothing better than having a Notion document or handbook that can answer my questions.

##### Feel close to each other
Choose the best way to communicate effectively and stay connected among team members. All the information required by someone from the team should be easy to find, one click away from EVERYBODY.

See you in the next class in which you will learn how to create your pitch!

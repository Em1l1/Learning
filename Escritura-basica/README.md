## Capitalization, Abbreviations, and Indentation

Capitalization is to write the first letter of a word with a capital letter (uppercase) and the remaining letters in lowercase.

English capitalization basic rules:

  - **The pronoun “I”: M**y sister and I watch TV.

  - **The first letter of a sentence: M**y name is Fernanda.

  - **Names and Titles:** This is **M**r. **J**ones.

  - **Cities and Countries:** I live in **B**ogotá, **C**olombia.

  - **Nationalities and Languages:** I am **B**razilian, and I speak **P**ortuguese.

  - **Days / Months / Holidays:** Today is **S**unday, **F**ebruary 14th. It’s **V**alentine’s **D**ay!

Abbreviations are any shortened form of a word. Two common types of abbreviations are acronyms and initialisms.

An acronym is an abbreviation formed from the initial letters of other words. You can pronounce it as a word.

  - **NASA** (**N**ational **A**eronautics and **S**pace **A**dministration)

  - **PIN** (**P**ersonal **I**dentification **N**umber)

  - **LASER** (**L**ight **A**mplification by **S**timulated **E**mission of **R**adiation)

An initialism is an abbreviation formed from the initial letters of other words. You **cannot** pronounce it as a word.

  - **DIY** (**D**o **I**t **Y**ourself)

  - **USA** (**U**nited **S**tates of **A**merica)

  - **DVD** (**D**igital **V**ersatile **D**isk)

You can form other abbreviations by removing a few letters of a single word.

  - **Titles:** **Mr**. Jones (Mister) / **Dr**. Gonzalez (Doctor)

  - **Times / Dates:** 10 **am** (ante meridiem) / **Jan.** (January) / **Mon**. (Monday)

  - **Places:** 5th **Ave**.*(Avenue) / Main **St**(Street)

  - **Units of measurement:** 20 **g**(grams) / 80 **oz** (ounces)

**Be careful!**

These abbreviations are only for writing. Say the complete word when speaking. Also, the punctuation may vary when using American English and British English:

**American English:** abbreviations always finish with a period (Mr. / Dr. / Mon. / etc.).

British English: abbreviations only finish with a period when they do not end with the same letter of the original word (Mr / Dr / Mon. / etc.).

When writing a paragraph, it is necessary to pay attention to its format. There are two formats you can use:

  - **First-line Indent:** start your writing further away from the edge of the paper. It creates a faster and also linear experience for the reader. It is common in fiction, narrative, biography, and scholarly publications.

  - **Block:** start your writing at the edge of the paper and use a margin of white space between paragraphs. In this way, the reader understands there is a new paragraph. It creates an idea of specific information in each paragraph. It is common in business guides and technical manuals.

## Punctuation

It is crucial to understand the correct use of punctuation if you want to write more clearly. Also, to create sense and stress in sentences and to organize your writing. At least one of the punctuation marks has to appear in every sentence.
It is easier to understand the importance of punctuation when reading a paragraph without any punctuation marks.

Every morning I wake up at 8 am the first thing I do is brush my teeth and right after that I take a shower next I dress up and I put on some makeup then I go to the kitchen and I prepare my breakfast breakfast is my favorite meal because I love pancakes waffles scrambled eggs toast with jam coffee and orange juice after I eat I brush my teeth again and I leave for work I always read a book on the bus right now I am reading The Great Gatsby and it is better than the movie usually I work until 6 pm and I go home after that.

#### Now read the same paragraph with the correct use of punctuation and notice the difference:

Every morning I wake up at 8 am. The first thing I do is brush my teeth, and right after that, I take a shower. Next, I dress up, and I put on some makeup. Then, I go to the kitchen, and I prepare my breakfast. Breakfast is my favorite meal because I love pancakes, waffles, scrambled eggs, toast with jam, coffee, and orange juice. After I eat, I brush my teeth again, and I leave for work. I always read a book on the bus. Right now, I am reading “The Great Gatsby” (and it is better than the movie!). Usually, I work until 6 pm, and I go home after that.

## Prewriting

The writing process starts when you decide what you want to communicate, why it is relevant, and who is the audience of your writing. There are five simples steps you can follow that will help your writing process to be more effective:

- **What do you want to communicate?**
- **Why is it important?**
- **Who is your audience?**

  1. **Prewriting:** explore possible topics, choose one, and collect ideas.

  2. **Drafting:** put all your ideas down on paper.

  3. **Revising:** read your draft and improve its form and content. You can add, remove, and change words. You can also rearrange the sentences.

  4. **Editing / Proof writing:** fix all the errors in grammar, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation.

  5. **Publishing:** present your writing to an audience.

> I think (for me) the most difficult step of writing is prewriting because I´m not very creative.

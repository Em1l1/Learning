## Capitalization, Abbreviations, and Indentation

Capitalization is to write the first letter of a word with a capital letter (uppercase) and the remaining letters in lowercase.

English capitalization basic rules:

  - **The pronoun “I”: M**y sister and I watch TV.

  - **The first letter of a sentence: M**y name is Fernanda.

  - **Names and Titles:** This is **M**r. **J**ones.

  - **Cities and Countries:** I live in **B**ogotá, **C**olombia.

  - **Nationalities and Languages:** I am **B**razilian, and I speak **P**ortuguese.

  - **Days / Months / Holidays:** Today is **S**unday, **F**ebruary 14th. It’s **V**alentine’s **D**ay!

Abbreviations are any shortened form of a word. Two common types of abbreviations are acronyms and initialisms.

An acronym is an abbreviation formed from the initial letters of other words. You can pronounce it as a word.

  - **NASA** (**N**ational **A**eronautics and **S**pace **A**dministration)

  - **PIN** (**P**ersonal **I**dentification **N**umber)

  - **LASER** (**L**ight **A**mplification by **S**timulated **E**mission of **R**adiation)

An initialism is an abbreviation formed from the initial letters of other words. You **cannot** pronounce it as a word.

  - **DIY** (**D**o **I**t **Y**ourself)

  - **USA** (**U**nited **S**tates of **A**merica)

  - **DVD** (**D**igital **V**ersatile **D**isk)

You can form other abbreviations by removing a few letters of a single word.

  - **Titles:** **Mr**. Jones (Mister) / **Dr**. Gonzalez (Doctor)

  - **Times / Dates:** 10 **am** (ante meridiem) / **Jan.** (January) / **Mon**. (Monday)

  - **Places:** 5th **Ave**.*(Avenue) / Main **St**(Street)

  - **Units of measurement:** 20 **g**(grams) / 80 **oz** (ounces)

**Be careful!**

These abbreviations are only for writing. Say the complete word when speaking. Also, the punctuation may vary when using American English and British English:

**American English:** abbreviations always finish with a period (Mr. / Dr. / Mon. / etc.).

British English: abbreviations only finish with a period when they do not end with the same letter of the original word (Mr / Dr / Mon. / etc.).

When writing a paragraph, it is necessary to pay attention to its format. There are two formats you can use:

  - **First-line Indent:** start your writing further away from the edge of the paper. It creates a faster and also linear experience for the reader. It is common in fiction, narrative, biography, and scholarly publications.

  - **Block:** start your writing at the edge of the paper and use a margin of white space between paragraphs. In this way, the reader understands there is a new paragraph. It creates an idea of specific information in each paragraph. It is common in business guides and technical manuals.

## Punctuation

It is crucial to understand the correct use of punctuation if you want to write more clearly. Also, to create sense and stress in sentences and to organize your writing. At least one of the punctuation marks has to appear in every sentence.
It is easier to understand the importance of punctuation when reading a paragraph without any punctuation marks.

Every morning I wake up at 8 am the first thing I do is brush my teeth and right after that I take a shower next I dress up and I put on some makeup then I go to the kitchen and I prepare my breakfast breakfast is my favorite meal because I love pancakes waffles scrambled eggs toast with jam coffee and orange juice after I eat I brush my teeth again and I leave for work I always read a book on the bus right now I am reading The Great Gatsby and it is better than the movie usually I work until 6 pm and I go home after that.

#### Now read the same paragraph with the correct use of punctuation and notice the difference:

Every morning I wake up at 8 am. The first thing I do is brush my teeth, and right after that, I take a shower. Next, I dress up, and I put on some makeup. Then, I go to the kitchen, and I prepare my breakfast. Breakfast is my favorite meal because I love pancakes, waffles, scrambled eggs, toast with jam, coffee, and orange juice. After I eat, I brush my teeth again, and I leave for work. I always read a book on the bus. Right now, I am reading “The Great Gatsby” (and it is better than the movie!). Usually, I work until 6 pm, and I go home after that.

## Prewriting

The writing process starts when you decide what you want to communicate, why it is relevant, and who is the audience of your writing. There are five simples steps you can follow that will help your writing process to be more effective:

- **What do you want to communicate?**
- **Why is it important?**
- **Who is your audience?**

  1. **Prewriting:** explore possible topics, choose one, and collect ideas.

  2. **Drafting:** put all your ideas down on paper.

  3. **Revising:** read your draft and improve its form and content. You can add, remove, and change words. You can also rearrange the sentences.

  4. **Editing / Proof writing:** fix all the errors in grammar, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation.

  5. **Publishing:** present your writing to an audience.

> I think (for me) the most difficult step of writing is prewriting because I´m not very creative.

# 2. Writing a Sentence
## Parts of speech

The parts of speech are the categories of the words in traditional English grammar. We can divide them into eight main groups (or nine, if you count determiners): nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections.
The following chart contains the parts of speech, their functions, and some examples of words and sentences.

# PARTS OF SPEECH

| PART OF SPEECH | FUNCTION                                                     | EXAMPLE                                                      | EXAMPLE                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| NOUN           | Names, places, things, or ideas.                             | Daniel / New York / dog / notebook / music                   | Daniel lives in New York. He likes to listen to music.       |
| PRONOUN        | Replaces nouns and other pronouns.                           | I / she / they / him / them / who / some / this              | Daniel lives in New York. He likes to listen to music.       |
| VERB           | Action or state of being. It tells what happens in the sentence. | be / go / eat / work / play / like / study / write / read / speak / watch / listen / live | Daniel lives in New York. He likes to listen to music.       |
| ADJECTIVE      | Describes, modifies, or gives information about nouns and pronouns. | hot / nice / big / wrong / intelligent / beautiful / smart / interesting | I have a nice car. Mark is intelligent.                      |
| ADVERB         | Describes verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.               | happily / quickly / well / often / really / very / always / too | They always watch tv. You sing very well!                    |
| PREPOSITION    | Links a noun or pronoun to other words in the sentence.      | to / for / but / in / on / at / up / over / from / under / of / with / about / near | The pen is under the table. I go there on Friday.            |
| CONJUNCTION    | Connects words, clauses, phrases, and ideas in a sentence.   | for / and / but / or / yet / with / is / as…as / because / while | I drink coffee and tea. He likes blue, but he doesn’t like green. |
| INTERJECTION   | Expresses strong emotions or reactions.                      | oh / wow / ouch / aha / gosh / well / phew / whoops / hooray | Wow! That’s beautiful. Ouch! It hurts.                       |

There is a discussion about determiners being a part of speech since they have similar functions to adjectives, articles, and pronouns. There are four types of determiners in English: articles, demonstratives, quantifiers, and possessives.

|                   DETERMINER                    |
| :---------------------------------------------: |
|  Specifies and identifies nouns and pronouns.   |
| that / those / some / few / such / the / a / an |
|               The dog is barking.               |
|              I have some oranges.               |

As we saw with the determiners, many words in English have more than one job. For example, “close” can be a verb, a noun, an adjective, and even an adverb. The spelling is the same, but the meanings are different.

- **VERB:** Can you please **close** the door?
- **NOUN:** It came to a **close**.
- **ADJECTIVE:** We are **close** friends.
- **ADVERB:** Don’t be so **close** to each other.

It is crucial to understand the parts of speech, so you define the exact word order and the correct use of punctuation in a sentence.
Now, try to write sentences using as many parts of speech as you can. Here is an example:

| Oh,     | he    | and   | his  | old  | dog  | walked | to    | the  | park | slowly. |
| ------- | ----- | ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ------ | ----- | ---- | ---- | ------- |
| Interj. | Pron. | Conj. | Det. | Adj. | Noun | Verb   | Prep. | Det. | Noun | Adv.    |

Wow! I didn’t know that the parts of a speech can divide into nine main groups of categories. It was difficult for me to learn the parts of speech, so this class helps me a lot. However, I need to practice every day to understand more about this section and until I can write easily.

I think that in these small sentences, I use several parts of speech, am I right?

Nouns: sentences, parts, speech, about
**Verbs**: practice, know, learn, use, write
**Adjective**: difficult, several, small
**Adverb**: a lot, easily
**Pronoun**: I, it
**Conjunction**: However, and
**Interjection**: Wow
**Preposition**: in, to, of
**Determines**: these, that

Fact: in writing these sentences it took me about fifteen minutes, which is a lot, I think.

## Types of Sentences

According to the Cambridge Dictionary, a sentence is “A [group](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/group) of words, usually [containing](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/contain) a [verb](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/verb), that [expresses](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/express) a [thought](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/thought) in the [form](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/form) of a statement, question, instruction, or exclamation and [starts](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/start) with a [capital](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/capital) [letter](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/letter) when written.”

We can say that a sentence is a word or a group of words that express a complete thought. There are four types of sentences:

- **Declarative** (statement): Tells us something, gives some information.

  -I like chocolate.
  -I don’t like chocolate.

- **Imperative** (command): Tells us to do something. It normally does not have a subject, because it is understood, the subject is you.

  -Eat.
  -Don’t eat!

- **Interrogative** (question): Asks us something, wants some information.
  -Don’t you like chocolate?
  -Where is your house?

- **Exclamation** (exclamation): Expresses emotion or surprise.

  -What a surprise!
  -How nice!

  #### Sentences are:

  - The train will arrive in 15 minutes. (*Declarative*)
  - Stay back from the bear! (*Imperative*)
  - Why are you here? (*Interrogative*)
  - That’s sweet! (*Exclamation*)
  - **Declarative** I like my work
  - **Imperative** Do your homework now!
  - **Interrogative** Do you bought the dinner last night?
  - **Exclamation** It’s a wonderful work Maria, well done!

## Combining Sentences

Both independent and dependent clauses are groups of words that contain a subject and a verb. The difference is that an independent clause expresses a complete thought and a dependent clause does not. So, an independent clause can stand alone as a sentence.

There are four different sentence structures: simple, compound, complex, and compound-complex.

1. **Simple:** one independent clause.

- Lisa is my neighbor.

1. **Compound:** two or more independent clauses.

- Lisa is my neighbor, and she is my friend.

1. **Complex:** one independent clause, one or more dependent clauses.

- I am her friend because she is adorable.

1. **Compound-complex:** two or more independent clauses, one or more dependent clauses.

- I am her friend because she is adorable, so we are always together.

We are going to work with the two first ones: SIMPLE and COMPOUND. We can combine two independent clauses using a period, a semicolon, or coordinating conjunctions. It is necessary to do it so you can avoid run-on sentences.

- **Period:** We have a new student. He is from Italy.
- **Semicolon:** We have a new student; he is from Italy.
- **Coordinating conjunction:** We have a new student, **and** he is from Italy.

A coordinating conjunction is a word that joins two elements: two verbs, two adjectives, two phrases, two independent clauses, and so on. They are used to make the ideas sound more fluent.

When using them to join two independent clauses, use a comma before the conjunction. It is easier to remember all the coordinating conjunctions with the acronym **FAN-BOYS** (**F**or, **A**nd, **N**or, **B**ut, **O**r, **Y**et, and **S**o).

**Use of coordinating conjunctions**

- Laura studied a lot, for she had an exam.
- I will travel to Canada, and my husband will travel too.
- I didn’t clean the house, nor did she.
- Sandra likes bread, but her sister prefer fruits.
- We can go to swim tomorrow, or we can go on weekend.
- Mike saved a lot of money, yet he can’t buy his own apartment.
- I talk with my mother, so I’m very happy.

*Remember one thing Platzi is a way of learning, but If you a lover of knowledge. There is everywhere so you don’t need a platform or an institute*

## Connectors

**Connectors** are linking words used to connect words or phrases. There are many different connectors in English, and we can classify them into different categories: addition, cause/effect, comparison, conclusion, contrast, emphasis, illustration, time/ sequence, etc.
We separate the categories according to their use:

| CATEGORY          | USE                                                          | EXAMPLE                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ADDITION          | Adds one phrase to another, gives extra information, or introduces additional ideas. | I have coffee and pancakes for breakfast. Additionally, I eat fruits. |
| CAUSE AND EFFECT  | Explains the reason for something and the consequence of an action. | I don’t like to study very much. For this reason, I always fail my exams. |

| CONCLUSION        | Concludes ideas.                                             | In conclusion, nobody is perfect.                            |
| CONTRAST          | Links two contrasting ideas.                                 | I love watching movies. However, I don’t like watching TV shows. |
| EMPHASIS          | Emphasizes ideas.                                            | I love watching movies, especially dramas.                   |
| ILLUSTRATION      | Exemplifies something.                                       | I can play different musical instruments, for example, the guitar, the piano, and the bass. |
| TIME AND SEQUENCE | Links actions that happened at the same time and indicates the order of the events. | First, brush your teeth. Then, go to bed.                    |

## Parallel structure

We should use a parallel structure to make your writing more effective. Be sure that all the items are in the same grammatical form when writing a series of words or phrases in a sentence. You may use a parallel structure in different situations:

**Verbs:** the form of the verb needs to be the same.

- **WRONG:** I like **eating** pizza, **listening** to music, and **to play** soccer.
- **CORRECT:** I like **eating** pizza, **listening** to music, and **playing** soccer.

**Verb + noun:** some nouns ask for specific verbs.

- **WRONG:** They **read books** and **music.**
- **CORRECT:** They **read books** and **listen to music.**

**Noun number:** agree singular, plural, countable, and uncountable.

- **WRONG:** They sell **pineapples**, **oranges**, and **an apple** in the supermarket.
- **CORRECT:** They sell **pineapples**, **oranges**, and **apples** in the supermarket.

# 3. Writing a Paragraph

## Paragraph Structure

We can compare a paragraph to a sandwich. It has different layers, but in the paragraph, these layers are the sentences. In a basic paragraph, there are three different types of a sentences.

A paragraph has different layers of sentences. They are divided into three parts:

1. **TOPIC SENTENCE:** the topic you are going to talk about.
2. **SUPPORT SENTENCES:** a more detailed explanation of the topic.
3. **CONCLUDING SENTENCE:** the closure of your paragraph.

A paragraph consists of sentences about one topic. The most important sentence in a paragraph is the topic sentence . It is often (though not always) the ﬁrst sentence, and it introduces, states, or summarizes the topic of a paragraph. For example: Workaholics lead unbalanced lives. In formal or academic writing, all the supporting sentences that follow, surround, or precede a topic sentence—details, examples, and other facts—must be related to the topic presented in the topic sentence. If the last sentence of a paragraph isn’t its topic sentence, and especially if the paragraph is a long one, writers sometimes end it with a concluding sentence that restates the topic sentence or summarizes the paragraph. Concluding sentences commonly use phrases such as In conclusion or In summary.

## Topic Sentence

The topic sentence is the most important part of your paragraph. It is often the very first sentence. It has to be clear and to express the main idea.

**Be careful!**
There are many common mistakes you can make when creating a topic sentence. You should avoid the use of:

- **Facts**
  When you use facts, it is hard to develop the topic further since it is too specific.
- **Too general idea**
  It is also hard to continue your idea if you have too many things to talk about in only one paragraph.
- **Announcing the topic**
  Go straight to the topic. You do not need to announce everything you are going to write about.

An example of a TOPIC SENTENCE:
**I love bananas because they are convenient, delicious, and nutritious.**

## Supporting Sentences

After creating your topic sentence (with a clear topic and the main idea), start brainstorming what your supporting sentences are going to be about. It is necessary to think about the main idea to do that. The sentences you use to support your statement can be examples, reasons why you think that, descriptions of your topic, arguments, causes, effects, and so on.

It is essential to do this before starting writing. Like that, you can have a clear idea of what you consider fundamental to express in your paragraph. Write down as many support topics as you can.
What you have to do next is to choose at least three support topics and develop your ideas. You should write at least one or two sentences for each supporting topic chosen.

Remember to use different connectors when writing your supporting sentences. It is crucial to link your ideas when you put all the sentences together.

**Example of supporting sentences (one for each supporting topic):**

**Convenient: First, they are easy to eat. I can peel the banana, eat it, and throw the peel in the garbage.**
**Delicious: Additionally, I can eat bananas with cereal, other fruits, and ice cream. I can also eat it fried, and it tastes great every time.
Nutritious: Finally, they contain fiber, potassium, and vitamins, so they are very healthy.**

**Supporting Sentences:**

- Examples
- Reasons
- Descriptions
- Arguments
- Causes & Effects
- Details

**Before start writing:**

- **Freewriting:** All the ideas of the main topic.
- **Write one or two sentences for each topic**
- **Use connectors**

**Practice:**

1. **Topic:** Why practice calisthenics?

2. Support Sentences

   - Benefits:
     - Conditioning.
     - Muscle gain.
     - Strenght gain.
     - Improve balance.
     - Improve agility.
     - Improve coordination.
   - Free and easy:
     - All is by working with your body weight you don’t need to pay to a GYM.
     - You don’t need any equipment
   - Healthy:
     - It includes all the benefits of exercising.

   ## Supporting Sentences

   Can be examples of your topic. Can be a reason why you think like that; a description; some arguments; an they can be cause and effects, and so on. Remember, when you are going to start writing, you have to go through some stages.

   The first one is the prewriting. In this stage, you should gather all the ideas about your main topic, and put them down on paper.

   - Examples
   - Reasons
   - Descriptions
   - Arguments
   - Causes & Effects
   - Details

   Bananas are convenient, delicious, and nutritious.

## Concluding Sentence

The last part of our paragraph structure is the conclusion. There are different types of conclusions: a summary, a final thought, a personal opinion, or a bridge between paragraphs.

**Be careful!**
Do not add more information to the conclusion. If you need to add more information, you should do it by adding another support sentence. This final part of the paragraph shows to your reader that the topic is over.

**Checklist:**

- Clear topic sentence
- Supporting sentences relate to the topic
- Sentences connect
- Concluding without new information

The complete paragraph:

**I love bananas because they are convenient, delicious, and nutritious. First, they are easy to eat. I can peel the banana, eat it, and throw the peel in the garbage. Additionally, I can eat bananas with cereal, other fruits, and ice cream. I can also eat it fried, and it tastes great every time. Finally, they contain fiber, potassium, and vitamins, so they are very healthy. Overall, I believe you should eat bananas every day.**

**Checklist:**

- Clear topic sentence
- Supporting sentences relate to the topic
- Sentences connect
- Concluding without new information

**Practice:**
I practice calisthenics because it has a lot of benefits, it is free and easy and it’s healthy. Some of the benefits are conditioning, muscle gain, strength gain, improve balance, improve agility, improve coordination, and many others.
Additionally, is free and easy, because all is by working with your bodyweight you don’t need to pay to a GYM and you don’t need any equipment.
Finally, is very healthy, it includes all the benefits of exercising.
Hence, I think every person should practice calisthenics and adopt it as a habit.

# 4. Writing a Text
## Personal Profile

Remember the first stage of the writing process: identify your audience and the purpose of your writing. Your profile can be a bio for your Twitter or Instagram account or a job/college application. Consider this before starting writing since all the details should be relevant, informative, and appropriate.

When you do not know what to write, the easiest way is to start answering basic questions about yourself. You can use the answers to create the body of your text. Here are some examples of questions you can try to answer:

- What is your name / last name?
- Do you have a nickname? What is it?
- Where are you from?
- Where do you live?
- How old are you?
- When is your birthday?
- What do you study?
- What is your occupation?
- What languages do you speak?
- What is your favorite color?
- Are you single or married?
- Do you have kids? How many?
- Do you have pets? How many?
- Do you have brothers or sisters? How many?
- What are your hobbies?
- What do you usually do in your free time?
- What is your favorite food? Why?

**Example of a personal profile:**
My name is Leonardo, but my friends call me Leo. I am from the United States, and I live in New York City, so I speak English. I am 15 years old, and my birthday is on May 15th.

I did not say before, but I am a turtle, a ninja turtle. For this reason, I believe my favorite color is green, and I love my Ninjutsu classes. I like to practice my fight skills, for I fight the enemies every day.

I am single, and I do not have kids. I usually spend my time with my three brothers (Rafael, Donatello, and Michelangelo) and my pet Splinter. I like to watch tv in my free time, and my brothers and I always eat pizza at night.

## Describing

| PART OF SPEECH | FUNCTION                                                     | EXAMPLE                                                      | EXAMPLE                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| ADJECTIVE      | Describes, modifies, or gives information about nouns and pronouns. | hot / nice / big / wrong / intelligent / beautiful / smart / interesting | I have a nice car. Mark is intelligent. |

**To describe people**, you can talk about their age, occupation, family, hobbies, and use some adjectives to describe their nationality, personality, and physical appearance.

**To describe places**, you can talk about things to do there, sites to visit, and use adjectives to describe the weather and other details. If you are writing about your home, you can also talk about the rooms, furniture, and services nearby.

**Example 1 (Describing a person)**

My sister is my favorite person because she is intelligent, a good friend, and beautiful. First of all, she was always smart and ambitious, and she studied to become a doctor. For this reason, I believe she is a great person. Additionally, she is funny and a fantastic company in every situation. She likes to watch horror movies and practice yoga. Also, she is pretty, not only outside. She has brown hair and brown eyes, and she is fit and short, just like me! To sum up, she is an amazing person.

**Example 2 (Describing a place)**

I love living in Bogotá since it is cosmopolitan, you have many things to do there, and it has the perfect weather. To begin with, you can find an impressive diversity of people and cultures because people from different countries go to Bogotá. Moreover, it is the biggest city in Colombia. It is enormous, and there are many touristic places to visit. For example, in Monserrate Hill, you can see the entire city, and it is magical, but it is crowded on weekends. Besides, it is never hot! It is sunny during the day and cool and windy at night. I believe it is winter every day there. I love it! Overall, I want to live there for many more years.

### Exmple

The adjectives serve to describe people and places.
**People:**
My parents are the best persons that I’ve ever known, they taught me their ethical and moral values, both are solidarity and generous, but overall they are humble.
They are intelligent and aren’t tall, but either short, my father likes to watch movies related to themes like fiction, science, and the universe, he’s a working man and a great father…
My mother likes to play parchis, and hang out anywhere, she hates to stay at home all day, also she likes poetry and philosophy, she has a group on Facebook with a lot of followers and she helps people through it, she is also a great mother.
**Places:**
I haven’t traveled much, but one place where I went is San Luis Potosí —I’m from Guadalajara, Jal. (México)— and I went to San Luis Potosí with my old sister and we stayed there for a little more than a week, the sights were amazing, and there you can find a big diversity of flora, the unique thing that I didn’t like was the temperature, the air was so hot, and there was hotter 🥵

## A Day in My Life

We can describe a routine as the tasks and activities we typically do. We usually have a similar schedule every day, so we are used to doing things at the same time daily.

When you write about a routine, it is not necessary to mention the exact time you do every single thing. However, it is important to show your reader the order of the actions. You can do that by using connectors.

There are things we do every day, others just sometimes, and some we never do. It is common to use adverbs of frequency to express the frequency we do things. The Adverbs of Frequency are adverbs of time. There are many different adverbs of frequency, but for now, we can use the more common ones: always, usually, sometimes, hardly ever, and never.

Be careful!

The order of the sentence changes depending on the verb used. They go **before** the main verb, except for the verb be. In this case, they go **after** the verb:

| SUBJECT | ADVERB | MAIN VERB | MAIN VERB |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | --------- |
| I       | always | eat       | fruits.   |

| SUBJECT | VERB BE | ADVERB | ADVERB  |
| ------- | ------- | ------ | ------- |
| I       | am      | always | hungry. |

**Example of a routine 1:**

I have a similar routine every day. Every morning I wake up at 8 am. The first thing I do is brush my teeth, and right after that, I take a shower. Next, I dress up, and I put on some makeup. Then, I go to the kitchen, and I prepare my breakfast. After I eat, I brush my teeth again, and I leave for work. I always listen to music on the bus. I usually work until 6 pm, and I go home after that. I go jogging three times a week, and I play video games.

**Example of a routine 2:**

**My routine:**
My routine is a little similar every day. Every morning I wake up at 6:55 am or before. The first thing I do is make my bed and second I start exercising for at least a half-hour. Then usually I take a shower, next I dress up, and I meditate. After that, I organize my workspace and start taking some courses of Platzi, then I prepare my breakfast and eat, brush my teeth and continue with the courses until 12-1 pm, and I start with the online classes that usually end at 6-8 pm.
I am developing a scholar project and I connect with my teammates and friends from 6-8 pm or 8-10 pm, after that, I do my homework, next, I read a book and finally, I go to bed at 11 or 12 am 😃

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/hs94yGH/Routine.jpg" alt="Routine" border="0">

**Example of a routine 3:**

I wake up at 9 am. The first thing I do is smoke and drink coffee, then I have breakfast. I usually take a shower, but the pandemic turned me into a dirty person, hahaha. The rest of the day i make my homework and study English and programming at Platzi.

# 5. Writing an Email
## Informal Email

As the name says, we write an informal email in informal situations. You write an informal email to a friend or a relative, but you can also do it at work if it is to a person you are close to, and the message does not require any formal writing.
It is common to use contractions in this situation since it is a friendly message.

The informal email has a simple structure:

- **Beginning:** the greeting and your opening statement.
- **Middle:** here you can tell your news and talk about your plans.
- **End:** the closing message and your first name.



**Informal email structure:**

- **Beginning:** the greeting and your opening statement.
- **Middle:** here you can tell your news and talk about your plans.
- **End:** the closing message and your first name.

Hey Sean, how are things? Have you ever heard of Platzi before?

Let me tell you that I found a tremendous online school: Platzi. At first, I was unsure of enrolling in it, but after watching some videos and reading some testimonials, I decided to apply for a free trial, and oh my gosh! The community there, the teachers, the forums, all the stuff one can learn on that site is awesome! I already purchased a subscription and I’ll study data science, for the future is about discovering stories through numbers.

What do u think? I’m not crazy, just excited! Hope to see you soon and talk about this amazing school.
All the best,
Gibs.

## Formal Email

We write a formal email in more formal situations. You write a formal email when the message requires formality: when we exchange emails at work, apply for a job, or when the email is to a person you do not know.

Different from an informal email, you should not use contractions. Also, the vocabulary needs to agree with the type of message you want to convey.

The formal email also has a simple structure:

- **Beginning:** the greeting (using titles) and your opening statement.
- **Middle:** explain the reason for your email.
- **End:** the closing message and your first and last name.

**Example of a formal email (with mistakes) for you to rewrite:**

Hello Mr. John,
How are you? Thanks for this opportunity. It’s amazing.

I’m writing to confirm our meeting tomorrow night. Is it ok at 8 pm? I’m gonna be available only after this time ‘cause I have some other stuff to do.

Talk to you soon.
Bye,
Leonardo.

# 6. Other Types of Writing
## Review

To write a review is to give your opinion about something. It can be about a book, a movie, a TV show, a restaurant, any place that provided you a service…

It is necessary to present arguments to support your opinion. In this way, the reader can better understand your point of view. You also should offer some information about what you are reviewing to give context to the reader.

The activity for this class is to write a review about a movie or a TV series.

In the resources section, there is a worksheet to help you. Use the information you find online about the movie or TV show to complete it. That will help you to have a clear idea of what to talk about in each paragraph. There is also an example of how to complete the worksheet.

Also, here is the structure your review should have:

- **Paragraph 1:** Include the name of the movie/series, stars, director, basic setting (time and place), and genre (comedy, adventure, drama, thriller, etc.).
- **Paragraph 2:** Write a plot summary of the movie/series. Discuss the movie/series events, but be careful, do not give spoilers!
- **Paragraph 3:** Discuss some aspects of the movies/series justifying why you like or dislike it. Be sure you are specific, and you can cite examples of the movie/series.
- **Paragraph 4:** Give your overall opinion and reaction to the movie/series. Also, include your recommendations for potential viewers.

**Example of a series review:**

“Law and Order SVU (Special Victims Unit)” is one of my favorite TV shows. It is a drama mixed with mystery and crime. It stars Mariska Hargitay, Ice-T, Christopher Meloni, Kelli Giddish Different, and has different directors.
The series is about the routine of lieutenant Olivia Benson and her squad at the Special Victims Unit police station in New York City. Also, it shows the stories behind the crimes. Law and Order SVU is the TV’s longest-running primetime drama (22 seasons), and it is part of a successful media franchise called Law and Order. There are eight different shows.
There are two things I like about this series. The first one is the character Olivia Benson because she is a fierce and very brave woman. The second is all the stories behind the cases, especially when there is a lot of drama. On the other hand, I do not like when there are similar stories, but I understand. It is difficult to be always original after many seasons.
Overall, it is a fantastic series, and you have to watch it if you like a good drama and police series.

**Example Review**

**Banana fish**

Banana fish is based on an action shoujo manga by Yoshida Akimi. 1973, Vietnam - an American soldier goes mad and guns down his buddies. Since then, the only words he has uttered are “Banana Fish”… Nowadays, in New York City, police investigate a series of puzzling suicides and a dying man gives a charismatic young gang leader named Ash Lynx a vial of a mysterious substance.

Ash Lynx is a teenage gang leader in New York City, Eiji Okumura, a Japanese photographer’s assistant.
Ash, Ash’s best friends, and Eiji end up investigating the origin of ‘Banana Fish’, uncovering a conspiracy that threatens the world.
Banana Fish is a masterpiece. When I started, my first thought was “Oh my god, another yaoi without plot” But I was so wrong!!!
Every episode destroys your mental health, hurts like hell. I couldn’t stop crying in every episode. I seriously recommend Banana fish. It’s my favorite anime, every detail is amazing.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/b2vbTg9/www.jpg" alt="www" border="0">

**“Mr. Robot”**

“Mr. Robot” is one of my favorite TV series. It is a techno-thriller
mixed with drama. His director was Sam Esmail.
The series is about the history of an engineer that works in an
informatic security corporation named AllSafe. Also shows the
importance and aims of a group of hackers named fsociety that
pretend to use different strategies to destroy the bank records of
**E-corp.**
There are two things that I like about this series. The first one is
the way in that you can interpret the history and assume a
personal perspective of the serie. The second is the excellent
performance and professionalism of the characters; for this reason
in the other hand, I do not like the short participation of some
characters.
Overall, it is an interesting and amazing series, and you have to
watch if you like hacking and informatic security.

## Biography

To write a biography is necessary to use the verbs in the third person.

**Be careful!**
If you are writing about a person who has passed away, you must remember to use all verbs in the past. If you are writing about a person who is alive, use verbs in the past for finished actions and verbs in the present for current ones.

Here are some examples of things you can write about in the artist’s biography:

- Occupation
- Nationality
- Birthday
- Family
- Specific information
- Favorites

The activity for this class is to write a biography about an artist of your choice.
In the resources section, there is a worksheet to help you. Use the information you find online about the artist to complete it. That will help you to have a clear idea of what to talk about in each paragraph. There is also an example of how to complete the worksheet.

Also, here is the structure your review should have:

- **Paragraph 1:** Include the name of your artist, his/her occupation, his/her nationality, the place, and the date he/she was born.
- **Paragraph 2:** Write about your artist’s family and personal life. Tell some fun facts!
- **Paragraph 3:** Discuss some aspects of your artist’s career and professional life. Do not forget to mention his/her achievements.
- **Paragraph 4:** Mention his/her likes and dislikes. Also, talk about your favorites.
- **Paragraph 5:** Finish saying the date and place of death or what your artist is doing at present.

**Example of a biography:**

Michael Jackson was born on August 29th, 1958, in Gary, Indiana. He was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer.
Michael had five brothers and three sisters, and he was the third-youngest with Randy and Janet. The Jacksons were poor and lived in a small house with just two bedrooms for eleven people. Also, he had two pet llamas on his ranch called Lola and Louis.
He was talented, and during his career, he earned 17 Grammys (14 as a solo artist, one with the Jackson 5). Moreover, he earned 26 American Music Awards, 40 Billboard Music Awards, and 13 World Music Awards. Additionally, his album, Thriller, was number one on the Billboard chart for 37 weeks.
Michael liked many things. For example, he loved reading books. His love for books began as a young teen, and he loved to read Peter Pan. He also liked art: paintings, classic music, and other things. He liked animals, toys, old castles, and beautiful Cartoons with a good ending. He disliked journalists, solitude, unfair friends, and rumors about him. My favorite Michael Jackson’s songs are Your rock my world, The way you make me feel, and Billie Jean.
He was the best selling artist in the United States for 2009, the year of his death. He died on June 25th, 2009, in Los Angeles, California. Michael was 50 years old.

**Be careful!**

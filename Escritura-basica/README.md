## Capitalization, Abbreviations, and Indentation

Capitalization is to write the first letter of a word with a capital letter (uppercase) and the remaining letters in lowercase.

English capitalization basic rules:

  - **The pronoun “I”: M**y sister and I watch TV.

  - **The first letter of a sentence: M**y name is Fernanda.

  - **Names and Titles:** This is **M**r. **J**ones.

  - **Cities and Countries:** I live in **B**ogotá, **C**olombia.

  - **Nationalities and Languages:** I am **B**razilian, and I speak **P**ortuguese.

  - **Days / Months / Holidays:** Today is **S**unday, **F**ebruary 14th. It’s **V**alentine’s **D**ay!

Abbreviations are any shortened form of a word. Two common types of abbreviations are acronyms and initialisms.

An acronym is an abbreviation formed from the initial letters of other words. You can pronounce it as a word.

  - **NASA** (**N**ational **A**eronautics and **S**pace **A**dministration)

  - **PIN** (**P**ersonal **I**dentification **N**umber)

  - **LASER** (**L**ight **A**mplification by **S**timulated **E**mission of **R**adiation)

An initialism is an abbreviation formed from the initial letters of other words. You **cannot** pronounce it as a word.

  - **DIY** (**D**o **I**t **Y**ourself)

  - **USA** (**U**nited **S**tates of **A**merica)

  - **DVD** (**D**igital **V**ersatile **D**isk)

You can form other abbreviations by removing a few letters of a single word.

  - **Titles:** **Mr**. Jones (Mister) / **Dr**. Gonzalez (Doctor)

  - **Times / Dates:** 10 **am** (ante meridiem) / **Jan.** (January) / **Mon**. (Monday)

  - **Places:** 5th **Ave**.*(Avenue) / Main **St**(Street)

  - **Units of measurement:** 20 **g**(grams) / 80 **oz** (ounces)

**Be careful!**

These abbreviations are only for writing. Say the complete word when speaking. Also, the punctuation may vary when using American English and British English:

**American English:** abbreviations always finish with a period (Mr. / Dr. / Mon. / etc.).

British English: abbreviations only finish with a period when they do not end with the same letter of the original word (Mr / Dr / Mon. / etc.).

When writing a paragraph, it is necessary to pay attention to its format. There are two formats you can use:

  - **First-line Indent:** start your writing further away from the edge of the paper. It creates a faster and also linear experience for the reader. It is common in fiction, narrative, biography, and scholarly publications.

  - **Block:** start your writing at the edge of the paper and use a margin of white space between paragraphs. In this way, the reader understands there is a new paragraph. It creates an idea of specific information in each paragraph. It is common in business guides and technical manuals.

## Punctuation

It is crucial to understand the correct use of punctuation if you want to write more clearly. Also, to create sense and stress in sentences and to organize your writing. At least one of the punctuation marks has to appear in every sentence.
It is easier to understand the importance of punctuation when reading a paragraph without any punctuation marks.

Every morning I wake up at 8 am the first thing I do is brush my teeth and right after that I take a shower next I dress up and I put on some makeup then I go to the kitchen and I prepare my breakfast breakfast is my favorite meal because I love pancakes waffles scrambled eggs toast with jam coffee and orange juice after I eat I brush my teeth again and I leave for work I always read a book on the bus right now I am reading The Great Gatsby and it is better than the movie usually I work until 6 pm and I go home after that.

#### Now read the same paragraph with the correct use of punctuation and notice the difference:

Every morning I wake up at 8 am. The first thing I do is brush my teeth, and right after that, I take a shower. Next, I dress up, and I put on some makeup. Then, I go to the kitchen, and I prepare my breakfast. Breakfast is my favorite meal because I love pancakes, waffles, scrambled eggs, toast with jam, coffee, and orange juice. After I eat, I brush my teeth again, and I leave for work. I always read a book on the bus. Right now, I am reading “The Great Gatsby” (and it is better than the movie!). Usually, I work until 6 pm, and I go home after that.

## Prewriting

The writing process starts when you decide what you want to communicate, why it is relevant, and who is the audience of your writing. There are five simples steps you can follow that will help your writing process to be more effective:

- **What do you want to communicate?**
- **Why is it important?**
- **Who is your audience?**

  1. **Prewriting:** explore possible topics, choose one, and collect ideas.

  2. **Drafting:** put all your ideas down on paper.

  3. **Revising:** read your draft and improve its form and content. You can add, remove, and change words. You can also rearrange the sentences.

  4. **Editing / Proof writing:** fix all the errors in grammar, spelling, capitalization, and punctuation.

  5. **Publishing:** present your writing to an audience.

> I think (for me) the most difficult step of writing is prewriting because I´m not very creative.

# 2. Writing a Sentence
## Parts of speech

The parts of speech are the categories of the words in traditional English grammar. We can divide them into eight main groups (or nine, if you count determiners): nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections.
The following chart contains the parts of speech, their functions, and some examples of words and sentences.

# PARTS OF SPEECH

| PART OF SPEECH | FUNCTION                                                     | EXAMPLE                                                      | EXAMPLE                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| NOUN           | Names, places, things, or ideas.                             | Daniel / New York / dog / notebook / music                   | Daniel lives in New York. He likes to listen to music.       |
| PRONOUN        | Replaces nouns and other pronouns.                           | I / she / they / him / them / who / some / this              | Daniel lives in New York. He likes to listen to music.       |
| VERB           | Action or state of being. It tells what happens in the sentence. | be / go / eat / work / play / like / study / write / read / speak / watch / listen / live | Daniel lives in New York. He likes to listen to music.       |
| ADJECTIVE      | Describes, modifies, or gives information about nouns and pronouns. | hot / nice / big / wrong / intelligent / beautiful / smart / interesting | I have a nice car. Mark is intelligent.                      |
| ADVERB         | Describes verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.               | happily / quickly / well / often / really / very / always / too | They always watch tv. You sing very well!                    |
| PREPOSITION    | Links a noun or pronoun to other words in the sentence.      | to / for / but / in / on / at / up / over / from / under / of / with / about / near | The pen is under the table. I go there on Friday.            |
| CONJUNCTION    | Connects words, clauses, phrases, and ideas in a sentence.   | for / and / but / or / yet / with / is / as…as / because / while | I drink coffee and tea. He likes blue, but he doesn’t like green. |
| INTERJECTION   | Expresses strong emotions or reactions.                      | oh / wow / ouch / aha / gosh / well / phew / whoops / hooray | Wow! That’s beautiful. Ouch! It hurts.                       |

There is a discussion about determiners being a part of speech since they have similar functions to adjectives, articles, and pronouns. There are four types of determiners in English: articles, demonstratives, quantifiers, and possessives.

|                   DETERMINER                    |
| :---------------------------------------------: |
|  Specifies and identifies nouns and pronouns.   |
| that / those / some / few / such / the / a / an |
|               The dog is barking.               |
|              I have some oranges.               |

As we saw with the determiners, many words in English have more than one job. For example, “close” can be a verb, a noun, an adjective, and even an adverb. The spelling is the same, but the meanings are different.

- **VERB:** Can you please **close** the door?
- **NOUN:** It came to a **close**.
- **ADJECTIVE:** We are **close** friends.
- **ADVERB:** Don’t be so **close** to each other.

It is crucial to understand the parts of speech, so you define the exact word order and the correct use of punctuation in a sentence.
Now, try to write sentences using as many parts of speech as you can. Here is an example:

| Oh,     | he    | and   | his  | old  | dog  | walked | to    | the  | park | slowly. |
| ------- | ----- | ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ------ | ----- | ---- | ---- | ------- |
| Interj. | Pron. | Conj. | Det. | Adj. | Noun | Verb   | Prep. | Det. | Noun | Adv.    |

Wow! I didn’t know that the parts of a speech can divide into nine main groups of categories. It was difficult for me to learn the parts of speech, so this class helps me a lot. However, I need to practice every day to understand more about this section and until I can write easily.

I think that in these small sentences, I use several parts of speech, am I right?

Nouns: sentences, parts, speech, about
**Verbs**: practice, know, learn, use, write
**Adjective**: difficult, several, small
**Adverb**: a lot, easily
**Pronoun**: I, it
**Conjunction**: However, and
**Interjection**: Wow
**Preposition**: in, to, of
**Determines**: these, that

Fact: in writing these sentences it took me about fifteen minutes, which is a lot, I think.

## Types of Sentences

According to the Cambridge Dictionary, a sentence is “A [group](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/group) of words, usually [containing](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/contain) a [verb](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/verb), that [expresses](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/express) a [thought](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/thought) in the [form](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/form) of a statement, question, instruction, or exclamation and [starts](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/start) with a [capital](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/capital) [letter](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/letter) when written.”

We can say that a sentence is a word or a group of words that express a complete thought. There are four types of sentences:

- **Declarative** (statement): Tells us something, gives some information.

  -I like chocolate.
  -I don’t like chocolate.

- **Imperative** (command): Tells us to do something. It normally does not have a subject, because it is understood, the subject is you.

  -Eat.
  -Don’t eat!

- **Interrogative** (question): Asks us something, wants some information.
  -Don’t you like chocolate?
  -Where is your house?

- **Exclamation** (exclamation): Expresses emotion or surprise.

  -What a surprise!
  -How nice!

  #### Sentences are:

  - The train will arrive in 15 minutes. (*Declarative*)
  - Stay back from the bear! (*Imperative*)
  - Why are you here? (*Interrogative*)
  - That’s sweet! (*Exclamation*)
  - **Declarative** I like my work
  - **Imperative** Do your homework now!
  - **Interrogative** Do you bought the dinner last night?
  - **Exclamation** It’s a wonderful work Maria, well done!

## Combining Sentences

Both independent and dependent clauses are groups of words that contain a subject and a verb. The difference is that an independent clause expresses a complete thought and a dependent clause does not. So, an independent clause can stand alone as a sentence.

There are four different sentence structures: simple, compound, complex, and compound-complex.

1. **Simple:** one independent clause.

- Lisa is my neighbor.

1. **Compound:** two or more independent clauses.

- Lisa is my neighbor, and she is my friend.

1. **Complex:** one independent clause, one or more dependent clauses.

- I am her friend because she is adorable.

1. **Compound-complex:** two or more independent clauses, one or more dependent clauses.

- I am her friend because she is adorable, so we are always together.

We are going to work with the two first ones: SIMPLE and COMPOUND. We can combine two independent clauses using a period, a semicolon, or coordinating conjunctions. It is necessary to do it so you can avoid run-on sentences.

- **Period:** We have a new student. He is from Italy.
- **Semicolon:** We have a new student; he is from Italy.
- **Coordinating conjunction:** We have a new student, **and** he is from Italy.

A coordinating conjunction is a word that joins two elements: two verbs, two adjectives, two phrases, two independent clauses, and so on. They are used to make the ideas sound more fluent.

When using them to join two independent clauses, use a comma before the conjunction. It is easier to remember all the coordinating conjunctions with the acronym **FAN-BOYS** (**F**or, **A**nd, **N**or, **B**ut, **O**r, **Y**et, and **S**o).

**Use of coordinating conjunctions**

- Laura studied a lot, for she had an exam.
- I will travel to Canada, and my husband will travel too.
- I didn’t clean the house, nor did she.
- Sandra likes bread, but her sister prefer fruits.
- We can go to swim tomorrow, or we can go on weekend.
- Mike saved a lot of money, yet he can’t buy his own apartment.
- I talk with my mother, so I’m very happy.

*Remember one thing Platzi is a way of learning, but If you a lover of knowledge. There is everywhere so you don’t need a platform or an institute*

## Connectors

**Connectors** are linking words used to connect words or phrases. There are many different connectors in English, and we can classify them into different categories: addition, cause/effect, comparison, conclusion, contrast, emphasis, illustration, time/ sequence, etc.
We separate the categories according to their use:

| CATEGORY          | USE                                                          | EXAMPLE                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ADDITION          | Adds one phrase to another, gives extra information, or introduces additional ideas. | I have coffee and pancakes for breakfast. Additionally, I eat fruits. |
| CAUSE AND EFFECT  | Explains the reason for something and the consequence of an action. | I don’t like to study very much. For this reason, I always fail my exams. |

| CONCLUSION        | Concludes ideas.                                             | In conclusion, nobody is perfect.                            |
| CONTRAST          | Links two contrasting ideas.                                 | I love watching movies. However, I don’t like watching TV shows. |
| EMPHASIS          | Emphasizes ideas.                                            | I love watching movies, especially dramas.                   |
| ILLUSTRATION      | Exemplifies something.                                       | I can play different musical instruments, for example, the guitar, the piano, and the bass. |
| TIME AND SEQUENCE | Links actions that happened at the same time and indicates the order of the events. | First, brush your teeth. Then, go to bed.                    |

## Parallel structure

We should use a parallel structure to make your writing more effective. Be sure that all the items are in the same grammatical form when writing a series of words or phrases in a sentence. You may use a parallel structure in different situations:

**Verbs:** the form of the verb needs to be the same.

- **WRONG:** I like **eating** pizza, **listening** to music, and **to play** soccer.
- **CORRECT:** I like **eating** pizza, **listening** to music, and **playing** soccer.

**Verb + noun:** some nouns ask for specific verbs.

- **WRONG:** They **read books** and **music.**
- **CORRECT:** They **read books** and **listen to music.**

**Noun number:** agree singular, plural, countable, and uncountable.

- **WRONG:** They sell **pineapples**, **oranges**, and **an apple** in the supermarket.
- **CORRECT:** They sell **pineapples**, **oranges**, and **apples** in the supermarket.

# 3. Writing a Paragraph

## Paragraph Structure

We can compare a paragraph to a sandwich. It has different layers, but in the paragraph, these layers are the sentences. In a basic paragraph, there are three different types of a sentences.

A paragraph has different layers of sentences. They are divided into three parts:

1. **TOPIC SENTENCE:** the topic you are going to talk about.
2. **SUPPORT SENTENCES:** a more detailed explanation of the topic.
3. **CONCLUDING SENTENCE:** the closure of your paragraph.

A paragraph consists of sentences about one topic. The most important sentence in a paragraph is the topic sentence . It is often (though not always) the ﬁrst sentence, and it introduces, states, or summarizes the topic of a paragraph. For example: Workaholics lead unbalanced lives. In formal or academic writing, all the supporting sentences that follow, surround, or precede a topic sentence—details, examples, and other facts—must be related to the topic presented in the topic sentence. If the last sentence of a paragraph isn’t its topic sentence, and especially if the paragraph is a long one, writers sometimes end it with a concluding sentence that restates the topic sentence or summarizes the paragraph. Concluding sentences commonly use phrases such as In conclusion or In summary.

## Topic Sentence

The topic sentence is the most important part of your paragraph. It is often the very first sentence. It has to be clear and to express the main idea.

**Be careful!**
There are many common mistakes you can make when creating a topic sentence. You should avoid the use of:

- **Facts**
  When you use facts, it is hard to develop the topic further since it is too specific.
- **Too general idea**
  It is also hard to continue your idea if you have too many things to talk about in only one paragraph.
- **Announcing the topic**
  Go straight to the topic. You do not need to announce everything you are going to write about.

An example of a TOPIC SENTENCE:
**I love bananas because they are convenient, delicious, and nutritious.**

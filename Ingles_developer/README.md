# 2. Communicate with your customer accurately

## Costomer-orinted requirements and importan concepts for iteration cycles

**Accurate communication**
* Customer requirements/Understanding the customer
* At the beginning some information might still be unclear - go back to the customer and clarify.
* Get info on requirements. Think of everything you need before you start building the software.
* What questions do you Think you could ask if we take the bicycle online sales as an example?
  - **Can you think of some questions?**
  - Let me know in the chat

 **Examples:**

 1. How many different types of bicycles does the software have to support?
 2. should the software allow any changes to color or model once bicycles have been purshased? 
 3. Doess the software have an administrator interface to make changes?
 4. Will the software to talk other systems? Paypal or others?
 
**Idea brainstorming**

A session designed to express ideas about the project design. any idea can be expressed.

Promote the right atmosphere to avoid having a foffy or muffled session.

> Two heads are better than one and four heads are better than two, as long as people can contribute  without criticism - Carlos arriaga.

The objective of brainstorming is getting good requirements that will create great result and great software.

You can also try brainstorming and observation as a complement to Brainstorming to gather good requirements

**User Stories**

Working, functional software is the primary measure of progress.

User stories help you sort out what is most important.

Your priority is to satisfy your customer throungh early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

User sotries should describe onde thing that the software needs to do for the customer, they must be short.

Written using language that the custormer undestands...avoid using technical terms.

User stories must be Written from the customer's perspective

**Example:**
AS A SUSER IWANT TO ... change my password
SO I CAN .... keep my account secure.

**Estimates**

After your initial requirement capture stage you will have clear user stories.

The customer will then want to know when those stories will be built.

How long will it take to complete the project? (Estimation)

Your estimate is the sum of all the time you take to build the user stories.

*Exmple:*
User story 1. Catalog creation (5 days)
User story 2. Selecting a bicycle (2 days)
User story 3. Selecting a color (2 days)

Total = 9 days.

## How iteration cycles works

**Iteration cycles**

The secret tp great spftware os Iterations, and constant communication.

You can't simply ignore customer during development.

Your get to ask the quwstion: how am I doing?

Each iteration is a mini cycle to produce quality software with requirements, design, code and test.

![](https://i.imgur.com/USdjEpK.jpg)

Each cycle produces working quality software. 
A process is really just a sequence of steps.

**Estimating the whole project**

Your iteration length should be at the right tempo for your project.

User stories define the *"WHAT"* of your project.

Estimates define the *WHEN*.

This is where the customer asks the big question: How long will it take?

Your project estimate is the sum of the estimates for your user stories.

To figure out how long it will take to complete all of the requirements captured in your sotries, you need to reach consensus in your estimations.

**Reaching consensus in estimations**

Let's analyze the next example:

**NEXT USERT STORY:** You need to enble the software to receive payments.

Think about people paying with a credit/debit card.

Developers may have different estimations based on the individual assuptions.

**Assumptions =**
The action of accepting something without proof.

**Exmple**

People will pay with a Visa or MasterCard

But what about Paypal? On Bitcoin? Or American Express?

Developers might disagree about estimates.

It is essential your team comes to a consensus, only then can you start estimating accurately.

Eliminate assumptions, have a meeting and agree on Estimates by playing planning poker.

  - [prioritizing with the customer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1svIVGr9pDJXkDn5EfEMUztu1j9ICRDOH/view?usp=sharing)

  ## Planning considering priorities

  **Planning considering priorites**

We previously played planning poker and the total time is: 300 days.

However, after informing the customer she says:
Listen, I don't have that much time, I will give you 90 days ...

What do you do?

Go back and prioritize your stories with the client.

The client is responsible for selecting the most relevant user stories, it's her decision.

You should have a meeting with your client, lay out all the user sotries and ask her about the order of the priorities.

Then select the set of features to be delivered in milestone 1.0

  **Milestones**

  A Milestones is major release.

  Your deliver your software (and your expect to get paid for it)

  This differs from iterations because during an iteration you show your customer the software for your feedback.

  A Milestones is about delivering software with baseline functionality.

  Don't try to include fancy functions, instead focus on delivering software that will cover baseline functionality.

  ![](https://i.imgur.com/PuWYdHZ.jpg)


  ## Review: communicate with your customer accurately

**Customer’s Inception:** Customer’s Inception is the customer’s initial idea to get software for various purposes.

**User Stories:** A User Story is the representation of an individual task the Software has to do, it is composed of smaller tasks and it contains a title, a description and a priority value.

**Iterations as part of a development process:** A work period after which you get together with the customer, show her your work and receive feedback.

**Accurate Communication:** It is key to understanding Customer’s requirements and avoiding mistakes.

**Idea Brainstorming:** Is necessary to get good requirements that will create fantastic results.

**Estimate:** The time you agree with your team to finish User Stories.

**Iteration cycle:** Is a little work cycle that produces quality, working software.

**Estimating the whole Project:** Takes place when you decide the length of the complete project.

**Reaching consensus in estimations:** Takes place when you have agreed on the length of the estimation with the entire team, after playing planning poker.

**Planning considering priorities:** Takes place after having a meeting with the Customer and agreeing on the features that should be included in the next Iteration. It is the Customer’s decision to include certain features.

**Milestone:** It is a MAJOR release, when you show your Customer your working, functional Software and and you expect to get paid for it.

# 3. Understand your customer and the requirements

  ## Prioritizing requirements

**Achievable development plan**

Setting ambitious goals is always important, however if your goals and the customer's goals are not aligned then there's a great chance something will go wrong.

At the beginning of each iteration, make sure you have the right set of features and that you're doing what you're supposed to do.

Stay customer-cocused at all times, only the customer knows what is needed.

user stories take priority based on your customer's decisions.

Help the customer make dicisions, lay out all your user sotries in front of him/her.

This influences the set of features that your software will contain.

**defining iterations**

The shorter your iterations are the better the chance yuo have to catch any modifications or any unexpected details quickly.

this way you can adjust your plans and change what you're doing if necessary before reaching a milestone.

**VELOCITY - Productive time**

People are not bots and you can't expect them to be working 100% of the time.

People have different personal issues to deal with such as:

- Holidays,
- Sickness,
- Paperwork.

Add a little reality into the plan.

- Factor in all those little things that can happen and prevent you from reaching 100% velocity.

- Velocity is how fast your team can actually work. It is a percentage.

- Given X number of days, how much of that time is Productive work.

- Your team will be working about 70% of their available time.

- This means your team has a velocity of 0.7 .I.e. For every 10 days of work about three will be taken up personal events. 

- At the beginning a 0.7 velocity estimate should be enough to start and adjust.

- This will give you a lrealistic estimate.

- Be confident in your plans by applying velocity and not overworking yourself and your team.

  ## Backlog and Milestone 1.0

**1. Bocklog**

It's time to set up your software development dashboard aka backlog for iteration I. 

The blclog is actually just a big board on the wall of your office.

Use it to keep tabs on what work's in the pipeline, what's in progress, and what's done. 

**2. Milestone 1.0**

Reach it as early as you can, during Milestone 1.0 try to iterate around once a mount to keep your development work on track.

When you don't have enough time to build everything ask the customer to reprioritize.

Once you have agreed-upon an  achievable set of user stories for milestone 1.0, set up your backlog and get developing!.

**This is an example of the user mapping stories**

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/D5g8WeH.png "user mapping stories")

**The kanban board, because is very easy to use**

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/w6DB8Vk.png "The kanban board")

**This is commonly used in the software development**

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/yqiX5cB.png "The software development")

# 4. Organize your tasks!

  ## Organizing your time into user stories and  tasks

**Break user stories into tasks**

Breaking user stories into tasks adds confidence and accuracy to your estimates and your plan.

User stories are like the ingredients of a bigger more complex "salad".

Tasks really add another level of detail specific to the actual coding you'll do for a user story.

**Use estimates to track your project**
**Update ypur backlog**

Track your projext form inception to completion.

It's often besto break out tasks from your user stories right at the beginning of the estimation process, if you have time.

This will add even more confidence to the plan that you give your customer.

It's always best to rely on the task estimates.

Tasks describe the actual software development work that needs to be done and are far less of a guesstimate than a coarse-grained user story estimate.

  - [updating-your](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ALwWyKSwhUJsfIMmXbwvMzj8WZjUXTUT/view?usp=sharing)

  ## Stand-up meetings, analyze and design

**1. Standup meetings**

You have some tasks i progress now, to keep everyone in the loop, you conduct a quick stand up meeting everyday.

- Track your progress
- Update your burn-down-rate
- Update tasks
- Talk about what happened yesterday and what's going to happen today.
- Bring up any issues
- Last between 5 and 15 minutes
- A daily stand up meeting should keep everyone motivated, keep your board up to date and highlinght anny problems early. 

**2. Analyze and desing**

Analyzing and designing your software as things start coming up is an integral part of the software development process.

The ability to pivot after seeing necessities that may ariese on the fly will demostrate your readiness and adaptability.

**Moderling your desing**

Once you realize there are things you need to change then you will need to model your design to fit the new requirements.

Modifications might forece you to add or delete tasks from  your backlog.

They might have an impact on the overall estimate for the project.

  - [burn-downate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cpbhlym3lCLt1sfQqKZnnxpnhjOWB95D/view?usp=sharing)

## Review: organize your tasks!

**Achievable Development Plan:** It is always important to align your goals with the Customer’s goals. Stay focused on your Customer’s requirements.

**Defining Iterations:** It is important you define your Iterations with your team. Iterations should be short, about 30 work days, that way you can catch mistakes quickly.

**VELOCITY-Productive time:** Velocity is how fast your team can actually work. In other words velocity is a percentage. Given X number of days, how much of that time is Productive work.

**Backlog**: The backlog is actually just a big board on the wall of your office. You should Use it to keep track on what work’s in the pipeline, what’s in progress, and what’s done.

**Milestone 1.0:** It is your FIRST MAJOR release, you show your Customer your working, functional Software and you expect to get paid for it.

**Break User Stories into tasks:** Divide the work into smaller, achievable tasks. By Breaking User Stories into tasks you add confidence to your Estimates and your plan.

**Use estimates to track your project:** Track your project from Inception to Completion, it is always smart to know exactly where you are and how you are doing.

**Update your backlog:** Your User Stories and tasks must be moving from the Pipeline to “in progress”, to “completed” all the time. It is important to update the Backlog daily.

**Standup Meetings:**Small daily meeting you have with your team to inform others of your progress, general feelings and difficulties.

**Analyze and Design:** Analyzing and designing your software , and pivoting when necessary is going to be an Integral part of the Software Development Process.

**Modeling your Design:** Once you know you need to adjust remember you must adjust your Backlog, User Stories and Estimates too.

# 5. Create deliverable design

  ## Creating deliverable design

**1. Refactoring your design**
Refactoring is the process of modifying the structure of your code, without modifying its behavior.

Reactoring is done to improve ypur code and your desing.

Refactoring allows you to have cleaner, more readable code.

Clean up any duplication, ugliness, old code, etc.

Once you're done coding, go back and clean up your code for the future.

**2. SRP Single Responsibility Princiole**

An idea of the SRP is that all of your classes, modules and functions should have only one Responsibility and one reason to change.

E.G Car-ponit A to point B.

Youu have implemented the Single Responsibility Principle correctly when ech of your objetcs has only one reason to change.

**DRY Don't Repeat Yourself**

__What is DRY?__

DRY is about having each piece of information and behavior in ypur system in a specific, single place.

The DRY principle is aimed at reducing repetition of infomation of all kinds.

__Imagine you have section of your code with__

1. A password request when you enter the firts page.
2. The same password request at the end of the shopping cart page.
3. Again at the end of the address confirmation page.

Avoid repetition - Make it DRY

Refactoring, SRP and DRY are all realated to improving ypur design. 

**I want to complement the information with this research that I did it.**

**This is an image with a SOLID design principles.**

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/yb68yTe.jpg "SOLID design principles")

**It’s an amazing topic.**

**Definitions are:**

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/8cyNdeq.png "SOLID ")


  ## Refactoring, meetings and release

**1. Reactoring and stand up meetings**

Refactoring is the process of modifying the structure of your code, without modifying its behavior.

Refactoring is done to increase the cleanness, flexibilty, and extensibility of your code, and usually is related to a specific improvement of your design.

**2. Definition is done**

When everything is complete, then you have definition, it's done.

**You have**

  - Finished all your tasks.
  - Done your refactoring.
  - Done any demos the iteration is complete.

  When all the work is done, so is your iteration...

**3. Ship out/Release software with quality and value**

Your software must always hove awesome quality and value.

You should aim at perfection ...

However, let's not get caught up in the idea of only releasing software when it's "Perfect".

Your desing should be "good-enough" to work well.

Perfect desing is just marvelous and fantastic, but delivering working, effective software is what pays the bills.

**Refactoring**

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/aofBxlO.jpg "Refactoring")

# 6. Protect your very valuable software

  ## Understanding the principles of defensive development

**1. Defend your software form yourself and your peers**

Imagine your are playing the Super Bowl. Your've just cored a touchdown that will give you the advantage over the other team.

What would you do?
Talk to your teammates and make sure their number one  priority is protecting that advantage that you have just gotten.

This is where the concept of Defensive Development comes from.
Once you have reached a point where your software is woriking you need to protect it and make sure it continues working.

Let's look at techniques to do that...

**2. Technique #1 - Version control With your code repository**

Version Control is a super cool technology you can use, it's one of the best defensive tools.

VC software helps you keep track of changes made to your code. VC allows you to control defferent version of yuor files, defferent version of your code, different version of what you have committed.

**Committing:** Is a very important word here - saving your files onto the version control software. You are committing new versions of your files into your VC repository,

Your commit those changes to your branch or branches. **The branch** is the file of code your are eorking on.

Withein this branch you can have additional branches, for different uses and  modifications on different brandhes. original file and modified version.

It lets multiple people check changes back into the repository and distribute them. It keeps track of the history - who changes what, when and why.

It tags so you can find version of your code from "way back when". Version contrl works mainly as a repository, it dosen't test your code. 

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/NVjQGEf.jpg "Version Contral")

**3. Technique #2 - Control your dependencies**

dependencies make your code more complex. 

sometimes you want to test some functionality of your code, but that functionality is tied to another task you haven't done yet. What do you do in that case?

Real-World cade always has dependencies, it's never isolated. Sometimes you have code that depends on something external, like a database.

You have to figure out a way to test that functionality independent of those dependencies.

Always check your dependencies for connectivity necessities. In other words, you need to dind a way to keep thidngs independent, but working together at the same time to male testing easier.

You can use tool like ANT for your JAVA Projexts and it all revolves around XML Build Script that is a file you build for ANT and tells the tool what to do when you need to build. Packaging ...

It's not enough to use version control to ensure your code stays safe. You also need to worry about compiling your code and Packaging in into a deployable unit.

Packaging your software is really important, remember that your software must be usable. I a nutshell - Take care of your work!

```php
?php 
echo "Hello World!"
```

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ft4o3IK.jpg "Test-driven development TDD")

  - [test-driven](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ApCNHpZeambNgw6VTVecvlIBBRSUsEpi/view?usp=sharing)

  ## Functional and unit testing

**1. Functional testing**

What things can go wrong in a development project?
Different problems will ariese when Working

Sometimes even the best developer breaks the build.

Coming up with tests is your job. There are a lot of good frameworks out there.

Remember they only run your tests, they don't build them for your.

A testing framework is a collection of tools that help you build your Tests. Your tests need to guarantee your software's optimal functionality.

Always think about functional testing.

**2. Techinique #3 - unit testing**

  **Testing methods**

  **Manual testing:** a developer or group of developers that manually start testing the code's functionality.

  **Automated testing:** If you have a more complex piece of software then it will be much better to perform autmated testing.


**3. Tecnique #4 - Let your peers undertand your code - Document ot!**

  **Unit testing**

  Unit testing is all about creating automatic tests for the smallest components of the code to test their business logic.

  That is going to be essencial to the development adn the effectiveness of your teseting.

  Unit testing ties together with the continuos integration process manu companies have, whenever new code is submitted to source control the software will test the build and email people to let them know there is a problem with their code.

  Thisngs may work great in isolation, but when different components of the code interact or when users use the system bufs can be overlooked.

  **System testing:** hooking everything together and then treating it like a black box. It focuses on the over all functionality, making sure the system handles interactions well.
  
  **Debriefing. Let uour peers understand your code - document it!**

  Have stand up meetings to:

  - Inform your customers of any chanfes you have made to the code.
  - Document your changes.
  - Analyze them along with your peers.
  - Keep them informed - reasons.

  It's important you vecome an expert communicator and standup meetings will be the place where you will be required to shine.

  Find ways to adapt your speech depending on your listener.

  ## Review: protect your very valuable software

**Refactoring your design:** Refactoring is the process of modifying the structure of your code, without modifying its behavior.

**SRP Single Responsibility Principle:** Every object in your system should have a single responsibility, and all the object’s services should be focused on that single responsibility.

**Refactoring and Standup meetings:** Refactoring is the process of modifying the structure of your code, without modifying its behavior.

**DRY Don’t Repeat Yourself:** DRY is about having each piece of information and behavior in your system in a specific, single place. The DRY principle is a principle of Software Development aimed at reducing repetition of information of all kinds.

**Definition is done:** When everything is complete , then you have definition, it’s done.

**Ship out / Release Software with Quality and Value:** Your Software must always have awesome quality and awesome value, aim at Perfection, settle for Functionality.

**Defend your software from yourself and your peers:** Test Driven Development (TDD) is all about writing your Code with testing in mind. It’s about writing Tests before any code and
letting these Tests drive your Implementation.

**Technique #1 - Version Control with your code repository:** Version Control is a super cool technology you can use, it’s one of the best Defensive tools you can use. Version Control lets
you create a repository to keep your code in a single place to ease backup and recovery.

**Technique #2 - Control your dependencies:** You need to find a way to keep things independent, but working together at the same time to make Testing easier. You need to find a way to apply Independent Tests. Create Mock Objects to do this.

**Functional Testing:** Your tests need to guarantee your Software’s optimal Functionality.

**Technique #3 - Always Exercise your Code-Unit Testing:** Unit testing is all about creating tests that run automatically to test the smallest components of the code for their business logic.

**Technique #4 - Let your peers understand your Code-Document it!** In form your Customers of any changes you have made to the code Document your changes Analyze them along with your peers. Keep them informed with reasons.

# 7. Understanding Continuous Integration (CI) and testing

  ## Types of software testing

  **1. Black-box**

There are diferent approaches to testing and different viewpoints.

Users see the system from the outside, they don't look at the database tables they don't evaluate the algorithms.

Users want functionality. For an end user a software program is a black-box

  - No code evaluation
  - No database evaluation
  - No algorithm evaluation
  - input-output
  - State transitons (e.g. GPS)
  - Boundary case errors (Month 13, day 23)

  **2. Gray-box**

Testers are looking for functionality. They do little bit more of deep dive to make sure things are really happening the way you said they would be.
This is gray-box testing.

Testers might be interested in:

- Auditing, not available throungh user interface.
- Data designed for other system (output), delayed ordes for example.
- System added information.
- Security risks, memory leaks, clean uninstalling.

  **3. While-box testing**

  Testing done by other Developers
  The deepest level of testing.

  They really look at all the details and look for:

  - Clas designs
  - Duplicated code
  - Representation inconsistencies, etc.
  - All the branches of code
  - Error handling
  - Code-on-code

  **Who am I**

  Let's play a little game. Can you guess the concept if I give you some clues?
  - I am the king of testing done by Developers and I am looging for glitches, bugs, and code duplicates...
  - I am the kind of testing done by end users, I am looking for functionality...
  - I am the kind of testing done testers, I look at the database, and other software building principles, but I don't go sooo deep...


  ## Handle accidents when building the code and what CI means

  **1. Handle accidents when building the code**


your are sure your code compiles, you have tested it and commited in into the respository. But something happens and your code doesn't compile. So the next person who checks it out of the repository is going to be in trouble.
How's your Continuous Integration?

There are many things that can go wrong with software development. Can you thikk of one example of problems that might arise when developing new software?
Do you have the same problems when you are working with small or big teams?
Leave a commet.

  **2. Continuous Integration CI**

  Contiinuous Integration is a technique that guarantees the reduction in the impact of comflicts by doing the following:

Core principles of CI

  - Continuously submiting working, runnable software into source control that will be built and tested.
  - Using antomation to enable source control to build and test the lastest version of the code submitted by the developers.
  - Continuous Integration tools run your tests as soon as you submit your code.
  - Source control emails the developers last involved in conflicts that appear when submitting.
  - Continuous Integration wraps version control, compilation and testing into a single repeatable process.

Source Control guarantes the impact reduction of conflicts. The benefits of using Source Control.

- Avoid Merge Hell 
- Fix bugs quickly, testable build.
- Ensure Ownership

All done through constant communication with your fellow Developers.

# 8. Test your Software!

  ## TDD Test-Driven Development

**1. Test-Drive Development (TDD) is all about designing tests first, then code.**

TDD is all about designing tests first, then code.

Unit testing system testing, black-box, gray-box and white-box, but what is the real philosophy behind all this?

Well, the idea is to think about testing as a driver.

_Testing is so Important:_ That you want to use it as effectively as you possibly can and to do this you need to follow the Test-Driven Development philosophy.

TDD is all  about writing tests before writing the code, and will allow you to have solid, specific ideas avout what your software needs to do.
This gives you clarity.

**2. Make your code go from RED to GREEN**

Most of the time you will be writing tests before you even start writing code.

Those tests will fail the first time you can run them and that is only logical. Before we write any new code we need to write a filing test.

RED!

Your goal is to get your tests to pass. That is to go "GREEN". 
"GREEN" refers to the green bar that JUNIT/Visual Studio display when the test passes.

  - Red = Failing
  - Green = Passing

Testing a single element promotes implementing the simplest code possible to make your tests pass.

RED-GREEN-REFACTOR!!!

**3. Never Skip Tests!**

Remember to automate your tests whenever possible.

  * Repetitive tasks
  * People vs Computers

  Do unit testing and system testing.
  System testing exercises the functionality of the system from front to back in real world, back box scenarios.

  ## Review: test your software!

**Black-box Testing** It’s the kind of testing done by Users, focusing on functionality.

**Gray-box Testing** It’s the kind of testing done by Testers, probably looking at the data, security risks, auditing.

**White-box Testing** Deep testing done by other developers, looking for inconsistencies in the Code.

**Continuous Integration (CI)** Continuous Integration is a technique that guarantees the reduction in the impact of conflicts.

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** TDD is all about writing tests before you start writing the code that will give the software its functionality, and will allow you to have solid, specific ideas about what your Software needs to do.

**Make your code go from RED to GREEN** The only goal you should have at this point is to get your tests to pass. That is to go “GREEN”.

**Never Skip Tests!** People aren’t great at performing repetitive tasks carefully, but computers are. Always test your Code.

# 9. Be ready for the end

  ## Prepare for the next iteration
  ---

**Correct and report your bugs!**

Eventually your testers going to find a bug. Actully they'll probably find lots of them.

So what happens then?
Do you just report the bugs to the team and fix them? Cycle?

**The actual life cycle of a bug**

  - A tester finds the bus
  - The tester files a bug report
  - You create a story to fix the bug
  - You fix the bug
  - Check the fix and verify that it works
  - Update the bug report
  - Reprioritize

**Add more user stories to fix your bugs (Always be adjusting)**

Now you are sure you have bugs in your code.

  - Fixing your bugs will take some time
  - This creates extra tasks
  - Remember akk tge tasks need to be

All that time needs to be taken into condideration when estimating the length of your iterations...

  - More User stories
  - more tasks
  - more work
  - more time

**Reprioritize your user stories**

The time has come to  reprioritize your stories based on the bugs. 
Reprioritization is critical because you want to make sure you are doing the right thing on the project at all times.

Constant communication is key. Reprioritizing user stories will call for adjustments on the fly or once iterations have finished.

Take this chance to adjust, adapt and overcome.

Getting feedbakc and recommendations from other developers can truly make a difference. 

Ask questions like:

  - What do you suggest we do here?
  - What are your thoughts on this?
  - What do you think should be our number one priority right now?

  ## End an iteration
  ---

**Plan your next iteration**

The end of your Iteration is here.
You have already finished the work for this iteration so it's time for the restrospective session.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/fvNLh8z.png "Plan your next Iteration")

It's important you have a standard set of questions to review, think about the future, calculate your metrics.

What questions do you think you can ask agter the Iteration?

Ask questions like:
  - What did we do well in this Iteration?
  - What are our takeaways after this Iterations/Sprint?
  - What are our areas of opportunity and how can we improve?
  - What are our main-points?

Once that is done, start again. Follow the standard procedure for Iterations.

  - Spaeking to the customer
  - Analyzubg the requirements
  - Coming up with user stories
  - Estimating user stories--learn from your VELOCITY
  - Playing planning poker to reach consensus
  - Start again

  ![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/fgusMiM.png "Think about this… I share a picture of example")

**Estimate again and learn from your data (VELOCIITY)**

Calculate your metrics and make sure you are readjusting after the iteration, your team may be working faster than you thought or more slowly.

Perhaps you could check your task breakdown approach.

Adjusting is good

Initial Project Velocity = 0.7

You have finished an Iteration and your team...

...Finished in a rush.
...Finished early.
...Finished late.

**What would you do in these cases**
**Leave your comments in the chat**

# 10. Fix your bugs!

  ## Handle bugs to fit your process

**Continuous delivery - fix functional bugs**

- Create stories to fix bugs
- Take into consideration when estimating time
- First fix functional bugs
- Everything revolver about customer-oriented functionality

**Estimate bug-fixing effort**

***Spike test***

- Period in which there is an “explosion” in the testing activities
- Random and continuous
- Weed out bugs
- Take a week to do it
- Pick a random sample of test that are failing and try to fix them
- Estimate bug fix rate

  ## Continuous integration test delivery method

**Continuous delivery as a method for functionality**

Continuous Integration Test Delivery is acloud enabled fast delivery for functionality.
It works better when two or more people are working on code, and committing new code to source control.

Frequency ensures fast response when a bug comes up.

This methid is really just a process for delivering functionality.

It lets your team be successful because you are delivering functional software that has been tested and delivered on time, with quality that is present in all your processes.

Remember this very counter - intuitive principle of software development:

- If it hurts do it often and it won't hurt as much.
- Beautiful code is nece but tested and readable code is delivered on time.
- Real success comes from dekivering functionality.


  ## Review: fix your bugs!

**Lifecycle of a bug**

- Tester finds
- Tester files a bug report
- Create a story to fix the bug
- Fix the bug
- Check the fix and test
- Update bug report

**Release your code to the real world**

# Best practices for software development in real life

**1. The definition of a software development process**

  _A structure imposed on the development of a software product that produces great, functional software_

**2. Developing iteratively**

  _Working following mini project cycles - Iterations, to promote customer feedback and deliverability_

**3. The backlog Tecnique**

  _It's big board in your office where you can track the progress of your User sotries and tasks._

  _There are three task classes on the backlog_

  _1. To do_
  _2. Doing_
  _3. Done_

  _Opt. Burn down rate/Calorie Burning Rate_

**4. The user stories technique**

  _A User Story is the representation of an individual task the software has to do, it is composed of smaller tasks and it contains a title, a description, an estimate, and a priority value._

**5. The version control techniques**

 _VC is a difensive tool (multiple access repository) that keeps track of the different version of your code._

**6. The continuous integration techniques**

  _It's technique that guarantees the reduction of conflict impact by putting together version control, compilation and testing into a single repeatable process._

**7. Test-Driven Development**

  _TDD id all about writing tests before you even start writing the code that will give the software its functionality, and will allow you to have clear, solied, specific ideas about what your software meeds to do._

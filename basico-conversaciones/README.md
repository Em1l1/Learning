### Useful expressions: Have got

In this lesson you will learn how to use the expression: have got

Have got is a synonym of have and it is used in very informal communication.

**Have got** solo se puede usar en presente simple (simple present), en otros tiempos verbales, hay que usar have.

**Have got** es más usada en inglés británico mientras que have es la forma que se usa normalmente en inglés americano.

Si bien **have got** únicamente cuenta con el significado «tener», have sí dispone de otros significados (tomar, haber…).

Example: 

  - I will have a cup of tea. (tomaré una taza de té)
  - I will have got a cup of tea. (esta frase sería incorrecta)

Otra diferencia entre ellas se encuentra en la forma en que construimos las frases interrogativas. Como veremos, sus formas interrogativas son muy simples.

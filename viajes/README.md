Example:

1. When I went to Germany, I didn't have any problem with the communication because almost all the people speak english and all the indications in the city are in this lenguage. It was a easy trip in this way.

2. When I had the opportunity to travel some countries to Europe I enjoy but when I want to do friends I realize I need to be fluently it was difficult to speak i hope to learn more dialogues.

[Virtual reality: Before the trip routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRfF0C215WE)

After watching the class practice reading the dialogues below out loud:

- Julia: ¡Nueva York nos espera! Estoy muy emocionada por este viaje pero me gustaría practicar más inglés antes de viajar.
¡Practiquemos! ¿Sabes cómo estará el clima? Quiero saber qué llevar.
- James: Dale, practiquemos!
- Julia: ¿Sabes cómo va a estar el clima? Quiero saber qué llevar
- James: According to weather.com it will be cold next month, it’s still Winter, it’s about 0 degrees celsius. It’s very cold.
- Julia: It’s very cold, yes. Winter! ¿Y las demás estaciones son?
- Jaimes: After Winter comes Spring, then Summer and then your favorite one and then Fall which I think is your favorite one.
- Julia: Yes! I love it!
- James: This is the one with the orange leaves all over the place?
- Julia: Yes! Well I also like spring because I love flowers… So I should take my “abrigo”. How do you say this one?
- James: “abrigo” is a coat. But it’s a short trip. I think you should take just one. But I know you’ll want to take more. I like that one!
- Julia: Ok, I’m going to take this one then.

- Julia: How do you say “bufanda”? Do you like this one?
- Jaimes: “Bufanda” is a Scarf, and yes, I like that one. This is mine.
- Julia: Oh right, that was nice.
- Jame: Thanks.
- Julia: ¿Este “sweater” será que es muy informal?
- James: Let me see… It is informal but I like it and I think it is perfect for the weather.
- Julia: Anda how do you say “guantes” y “gafas de sol”? Quiero verme fashion
- James: These are sunglasses.
- Julia: Oh right, sunglasses.
- James: And one of these is gloves. And you say I wank to look fashionable.
- Julia: Ok, I wank to look fashionable.
- James: Exactly. By the way, it’s a good idea to take sunscreen even if it’s cold.
- Julia: Sunscreen? Ahh eso es protector solar ¿verdad?

- James: Exactly. Are you taking those two pieces of luggage? Because I’m taking just this backpack.
- Julia: I don’t know. Maybe I need to take a big one.
- James: Of course. I can’t imagine. By the way, don’t forget about the passport, the credit card and the money. Have them ready.
- Julia: Yes sir! I have them right here, my passport. The money and credit card I have them there in my wallet
- James: Cool. I made the reservation for the Airbnb and I sent you the information to your email. Did you receive it?
- Julia: Si. Lo tengo

- James: Why don’t we practice what they will ask you in passport control?
- Julia: Ok, shoot!
- James: They say. Passport please?
- Julia: Yes, here you go.
- James: What’s your name?
- Julia: My name is Julia Jaramillo
- James: Can you spell your name please?
- Julia: Yes - J-u-l-i-a, and the last name is J-a-r-a-m-i-double L-o
- James: How long are you staying?
- Julia: 1 week
- James: What’s the reason for the trip?
- Julia: Party! Just kidding, I would say: Vacations
- James: Ok. How are you covering your expenses during your trip?
- Julia: I brought my credit card and some money
- James: Great, welcome to the US.
- Julia: Thank you!

James: What recommendations would you make for our trip to NY? Which clothes would you take with you considering the current weather?
